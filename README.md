# Recipes App

The goal was too develop a recipes app, where you could login, look for recipes, filter by meals or drinks, open a recipe, favorite it and follow the recipe, checking the boxes for every item/step you do. Besides recipes page and recipe details page, you can see the recipes you didn't finish and the favorites area. We also had to test the application using RTL and Jest.




## Pages created:

- Login page
- Recipes page (where you can filter by meals or drinks)
- Recipe details
- In-Progress recipes
- Done recipes
- Favorite recipes

## Stacks

React, React-Router, Javascript, CSS, RTL, Jest.

 - [The CocktailsDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
